# Notes

*June 23, 2025*: Four facilities listed by ICE on this date featured population averages that were impossibly high:

-   Fayette County Detention Center
-   La Paz County Adult Detention Facility
-   Lexington County Jail
-   New Hanover County Jail

Population numbers reported by ICE for these four facilities have been excluded from the dataset for this date.

*July 7, 2025*: More than half (96 out of 172) of the facilities listed by ICE on this date featured population averages that were impossibly low. While it's quite possible that ICE released correct populations for other facilities, the pervasiveness of the error has forced us to drop this entire dataset from release.

*July 21, 2025*: One facility listed by ICE on this date featured population averages that were impossibly low:

-   Northwest Regional Corrections Center

Population numbers reported by ICE for this facility have been excluded from the dataset for this date.
